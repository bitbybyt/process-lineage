## Project Overview :
* ### Problem Statement :
Developing a product that helps to visualize the entire process lineage with dependencies and bottlenecks of any business processes. A tool that can facilitate visualization of the current process – what is as of now executing, what is forthcoming and what has as of now finished. The time taken by each step ought to be determined, along with the total cycle time for each process. User should have the option to recover any process flow and view the path and time taken. 
* ### Proposed Solution :
Process Lineage is defined as the life cycle of the data. Data Lineage shows the complete data flow from origin to destination. While building the lineage system, we need to keep track of each process within the system where we are doing some data transformation or processing. We need to map data elements at every stage when the data asset is going through any processes. 
Value stream mapping(VSM) enables us to better understand what these steps are, where the value is added, where it’s not, and more importantly, how to improve upon the collective process. VSM provides us with a structured visualization of the key steps and corresponding data needed to understand and intelligently make improvements that optimize the entire process, not just one section at the expense of another.
Process bottlenecks are among the reasons why projects get delayed, budgets burst from the added cost of delays, and the whole process becomes unpredictable. It is a work stage that gets more work requests than it can process at its maximum throughput capacity. That causes an interruption to the flow of work and delays across the production process. The real issue lies in pinpointing the bottlenecks, from our observation we found out that rather than optimizing the machinery to make the process faster, we should try reducing the propagation time.
In order to make our tool viable with every other organization, we extended the inclusion of our databases and the datatypes. This would help us to gain maximum compatibility with every single sort of organization over the globe.

	Data Lineage plays an important role where key decisions rely on accurate information. Without appropriate technology and processes in place tracking, data can be virtually impossible or at the very least a costly and time-consuming endeavour.

## Scope of Expansion :
 The general idea is to make the business process more efficient in the following ways:
 * Implementing process-based artificial intelligence, process engineers can identify inefficiencies, such as the formation of undesired side products, process instabilities, impurities and more.
 * By applying industrial predictive analytics, we will have the ability to translate data into predictive insights. It will help us to anticipate exactly when process inefficiencies will happen. Machine learning algorithms can then be implemented to identify relevant events and predict their outcomes.
 * Predictive simulation determines how specific inefficiencies can be avoided by simulating how processes will behave in different scenarios, and how to avoid the anticipated process inefficiency.
